# Limud

An overwrought flashcard webapp to learn Biblical Hebrew (and to learn Flask / SQLite / ... in the same stride).

Follows the structure of the excellent "Learning Biblical Hebrew" manual and workbook by Kutz & Josberger.

# Features

* Conjugation tables by verb stem (or binyan)
* Vocabulary from the workbook
* Ability to add new vocabulary
* Practice (shuffled) mode vs. review mode
* Flashcard for both vocabulary and for verb forms
* ... and more!

Shalom!
